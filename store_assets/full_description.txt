🔬 KNOW YOUR PROTEIN — Scan any product to instantly reveal its true protein quality using the scientific PDCAAS standard.

Not all protein is created equal. That "30g protein" bar might only deliver 15g of usable protein. Protein Quality Scanner exposes the difference.

📊 HOW IT WORKS

• Scan any barcode or enter it manually
• Get instant PDCAAS protein quality scores
• See exactly which proteins are inside
• Understand amino acid completeness

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHY PDCAAS MATTERS

PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score) is the gold standard used by the WHO and FDA to measure protein quality. A score of 1.0 means complete protein. Many products score far lower.

• Whey protein: 1.0 (excellent)
• Egg: 1.0 (excellent)  
• Beef: 0.92 (great)
• Soy: 0.91 (great)
• Pea protein: 0.73 (good)
• Collagen: 0.0 (zero usable protein!)

🧪 THE SCIENCE

Your body can only use protein that contains all essential amino acids in the right proportions. Many cheap protein sources (like collagen, gelatin, or plant blends) are incomplete. This app does the math so you don't waste money on protein that won't build muscle.
